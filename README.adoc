== Replace Cookies
This is an example of how to store and replace cookie with gateway filters using Spring Cloud Gateway.

To run this locally you will need to run wiremock under `complete/src/test/resources/wiremock` with the following command:
`java -jar path/to/your/wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.33.2.jar`

There are two wiremock pages: `localhost:8080/setcookie` which sets a cookie, and `localhost:8080/requirecookie` that requires the cookie.
